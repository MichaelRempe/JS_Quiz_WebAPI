# Java Script Quiz Game
Testing my own knowledge of APIs and dynamic DOM manipulation through gameplay. In this case a simple quiz testing user knowledge on vinilla JavaScript. The user races against the clock to answer a few questions, where thier score is dirrectly impacted by how quickly they answer questions. However, incorrect answers will result in a time penalty.

This paticular app is still a work in progress, any helpful feed back would be greatly apreciated!
